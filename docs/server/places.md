# Places Feature

## What Are Places?

On the Hoobs Live YouTube livestream, places are also used as automatic camera angles. The stream camera will periodically switch to these saved places, giving viewers a tour of popular or interesting locations.

To manually switch the livestream camera to a saved place, use the following command in YouTube chat:

```
!spectate +my_home
```
or
```
!s +my_home
```
This will move the camera to the location you saved as `my_home`.

## How to Use Places

### Listing Your Places (In-Game)
