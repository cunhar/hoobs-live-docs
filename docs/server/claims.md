# Claims (GriefPrevention)

GriefPrevention is a plugin that helps protect your builds and land from griefing by allowing you to claim areas in the world. Claims ensure that only you and trusted players can modify or interact with your protected land.

## How to Create a Claim
- Use a golden shovel to right-click two corners of the area you want to claim.
- The claim will be marked with visual blocks (such as glowstone or gold blocks).
- You can expand your claim by right-clicking further away with the golden shovel.

## Claim Commands
- `/claim` — Create a claim at your location.
- `/trust <player>` — Allow another player to build or interact in your claim.
- `/untrust <player>` — Remove a player's access to your claim.
- `/claimslist` — View all your claims.
- `/abandonclaim` — Remove your current claim.
- `/abandonallclaims` — Remove all your claims.
- `/trustlist` — See who has access to your claim.

## Tips
- You earn more claim blocks by playing on the server.
- Use `/claimslist` to keep track of your protected areas.
- Only trust players you know well.
