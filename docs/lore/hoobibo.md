# Hoobibo

The Hoobibo was created when RandomRocketYT and RealBaconEater attempted to clone the Hoobasaurus. During the experiment, a bag of Haribo gummies was accidentally dropped into the concoction, resulting in the birth of Hoobibo.

Hoobibo is a warden who resides high above coordinates 0 0 in the Overworld spawn. Its origins are as mysterious as its powers, and it is known to watch over the land from its lofty domain.
