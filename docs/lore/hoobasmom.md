# Hooba's Mom

So, it turns out that Hooba's mom was not too happy about us summoning and killing the Hooba countless times.  Hooba's Mom has returned to her Nether palace and will scream at anyone she believes was involved in the aforementioned crimes.  To get her attention all you have to do is drop a **DRAGON HEAD** into her **stove** and she will quickly appear bearing Netherite Blocks!  If you are able to successfully defeat Hooba's mom, there will be a secret temple under her home with some additional gifts.
