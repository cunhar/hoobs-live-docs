## Cheating & Mods

We are a community of vanilla survival players. Any mod that gives you a significant advantage over vanilla is prohibited.

Playing vanilla means everyone is on equal footing, and the spirit of survival and creativity is preserved. Mods are evaluated based on whether they change gameplay, automate tasks, or reveal information not available in vanilla Minecraft. If you are unsure about a mod, ask a Moderator before using it.

### Examples of Allowed Mods
- OptiFine (performance and graphics improvements)
- Shaders (visual enhancements only)
- Replay Mod (for recording gameplay)
- Simple minimaps that only show explored areas
	- Resource packs that only change textures or sounds
	- Chat enhancement mods (that do not automate or provide extra info)
	- HUD mods that show vanilla info (health, hunger, coordinates)

### Examples of Prohibited Mods
- Hacked clients
- X-ray resource packs or mods
- Flying without elytra
- Block glitching
- Minimaps that reveal unexplored areas
- Inventory management mods
	- Auto-clickers or macros
	- Mods that automate farming, mining, or combat
	- Mods that reveal player or mob locations beyond vanilla
	- Mods that bypass vanilla mechanics (e.g., auto-fishing, auto-building)

> Note: Inventory management mods are not allowed, as they save you a significant amount of time and provide an advantage over vanilla gameplay.

## Lag Rules

Lag is passively managed by Blex. If any specific builds become a server-wide issue, Hoobs will contact you directly.
